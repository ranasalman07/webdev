        <P id="b3" > The Bugatti Bolide is a track-day-focused sportscar developed by Bugatti Engineering GmbH in Wolfsburg, Germany and manufactured in Molsheim, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., revealed online on October 28, 2020. According to Bugatti, the concept version of the Bolide is using the W16 engine with a weight-to-power-ratio of 0.91 kg/kW (0.67 kg/PS; 1.50 lb/hp). Bugatti announced the Bolide would be the last car ever made with their W16 engine. The Bolide's name comes from the term le bolide, which literally means "the racing car" in French. The fundamental concept of the Bolide is based on a technical draft of Bugatti chief engineer and "Technical Guru" Frank Goetzke.</P>
